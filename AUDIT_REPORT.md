# Full Stack Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a full stack audit of the premium-banking-monorepo project. The audit revealed a critical architectural flaw: the project is structured as a monorepo with a Next.js frontend and an Express.js backend, but the two are completely disconnected. The frontend is a full-stack Supabase application that communicates directly with the Supabase database, while the Express backend is configured to use a MySQL database and is effectively unused.

This fundamental disconnect is the root cause of many other issues identified in this report. The backend is non-functional due to a database schema mismatch and a missing `auth.js` file, and any security measures implemented in the backend are completely ineffective because the frontend bypasses it entirely.

The most critical security vulnerability identified is an insecure Row Level Security (RLS) policy on the `kyc_submissions` table, which could expose sensitive user data.

## Key Findings

### 1. Architectural Mismatch

*   **Finding**: The frontend is a full-stack Supabase application that does not communicate with the Express backend. The backend is completely unused.
*   **Impact**: This is a major architectural flaw that renders the backend and its security measures useless. It also introduces unnecessary complexity and confusion.
*   **Recommendation**: The development team needs to make a clear architectural decision. Either:
    *   **Option A: Embrace the Supabase-centric architecture.** Remove the Express backend and implement all backend logic using Supabase's features (e.g., database functions, edge functions).
    *   **Option B: Integrate the frontend and backend.** Refactor the frontend to make API calls to the Express backend for all data fetching and mutations. The backend should then be responsible for all database interactions.

### 2. Database Inconsistency

*   **Finding**: The backend is configured for MySQL, but the database schema files are for PostgreSQL (Supabase).
*   **Impact**: The required tables are not being created in the MySQL database, rendering the backend non-functional.
*   **Recommendation**: Align the database technology. If the team chooses to use the Express backend, they should migrate the database to MySQL and create the necessary tables. If they choose to use Supabase, the MySQL configuration should be removed.

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities

*   **Insecure RLS Policy on `kyc_submissions` Table**:
    *   **Finding**: The RLS policy on the `kyc_submissions` table is too permissive, allowing any authenticated user to potentially access or modify any other user's KYC data.
    *   **Impact**: This is a critical vulnerability that could lead to a data breach of sensitive user information.
    *   **Recommendation**: Immediately update the RLS policy to restrict access to a user's own data: `USING (user_id = auth.uid()) WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid())`.
*   **Missing Password Reset Functionality**:
    *   **Finding**: There is no password reset functionality.
    *   **Impact**: This is a major security oversight that would make it difficult for users to regain access to their accounts if they forget their password.
    *   **Recommendation**: Implement a secure password reset feature.
*   **Missing `auth.js` File**:
    *   **Finding**: The `server.js` file attempts to mount a route from `server/routes/auth.js`, but this file does not exist.
    *   **Impact**: This is a denial of service vulnerability that will cause the backend to crash on startup.
    *   **Recommendation**: Create the `auth.js` file or remove the code that attempts to mount it.
*   **Lack of Input Validation and CSRF Protection on Backend**:
    *   **Finding**: The backend lacks consistent input validation and CSRF protection.
    *   **Impact**: This could leave the application vulnerable to various attacks, such as XSS and SQL injection, if the backend is ever used.
    *   **Recommendation**: Implement a robust input validation strategy and add CSRF protection to the backend.

### 4. Other Issues

*   **Redundant Authentication**: Both the frontend and backend have their own authentication logic that uses Supabase.
*   **Inconsistent Validation Libraries**: The frontend uses `yup` for validation, while the backend uses `joi`.
*   **Unused Fineract API**: The `accounts.js` route makes calls to a "Fineract" API, but it's unclear what this API is or how it's used.
*   **No Tests**: The project has no unit or integration tests.

## Conclusion

The premium-banking-monorepo project has a number of critical issues that need to be addressed before it can be considered a secure and functional application. The most important step is to resolve the architectural mismatch between the frontend and backend. Once a clear architectural direction is chosen, the other issues, such as the database inconsistency and security vulnerabilities, can be addressed.
